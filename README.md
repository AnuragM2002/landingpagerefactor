# Module 1 Challenge

This website is a challenge where we had to refactor the HTML and CSS files in order to have semantic HTML and readability. 

Additionally, we had to remove the redundancies in the CSS. 

The original CSS file was 200 lines, but it was shortened to about 140 lines.

Comments were added to the CSS file to show the different parts of the landing page and describe what is being styled.

Website is hosted on Github pages.
